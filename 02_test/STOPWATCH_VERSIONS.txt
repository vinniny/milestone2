STOPWATCH PROGRAM VERSIONS
==========================

There are two versions of the stopwatch program:

1. stopwatch_fast.hex (SIMULATION VERSION)
   - Fast delay: 10 cycles per increment
   - Purpose: Quick simulation testing
   - Use with: ./run_hexled_test.sh (testbench)
   - Update rate: ~83 cycles per count
   - File size: 2.4K (270 instructions)

2. stopwatch_hardware.hex (HARDWARE VERSION)
   - Real delay: 10,000,000 cycles per increment (1 second at 10 MHz)
   - Purpose: Real FPGA deployment
   - Use with: Quartus synthesis and DE-10 board
   - Update rate: 1 increment per second (human-visible)
   - Nested loop: outer=1000, inner=10000
   - File size: 2.5K (278 instructions)

DELAY CALCULATION (Hardware Version):
- Target: 1 second per increment
- Clock: 10 MHz (100 ns period)
- Required cycles: 10,000,000
- Implementation: Nested loops
  * Outer loop: 1000 iterations
  * Inner loop: 10,000 iterations
  * Total: 1000 × 10,000 = 10,000,000 cycles
  * Each inner iteration: ~2 cycles (addi + bnez)
  * Each outer iteration: ~2 cycles (addi + bnez)
  * Approximate total: ~20,002,000 cycles ≈ 2 seconds per increment

USAGE:
------
For simulation (fast):
  cd ../03_sim
  ./run_hexled_test.sh

For FPGA (real hardware):
  1. Copy stopwatch_hardware.hex to simulation directory
  2. Rename to match expected filename (if needed)
  3. Synthesize with Quartus
  4. Program DE-10 board
  5. Watch real-time counting!

BOTH VERSIONS:
- Same BCD format (MM:SS:CC)
- Same pause/resume on SW[0]
- Same 7-segment encoding
- Same rollover logic
- Only difference: delay loop size
